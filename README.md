## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my 5th Frontend Mentor challenge! This was a great exercise in practicing layout skills, and a great opportunity for me to get more comfortable with CSS Grid. I first tried to implement this purely with Flexbox, then found that using Grid was more intuitive for the overall desktop layout. I then went in and changed the reviews and ratings sections to Grid as well. The staggered layout was giving me some trouble at first, but eventually I learned that I could mix responsive ```fr``` units with other length units to help create that layout.

It's also always good to expand my knowledge of HTML structure and semantics. I learned to use the ```<figure>, <blockquote>, <figcaption>``` tags for the reviews despite initially just placing them in generic divs. 


### Continued development

I've been focusing on HTML and CSS challenges up until this point, but I feel comfortable enough to tackle challenges with JavaScript as well now. I'm going to continue on learning best practices for structuring HTML and CSS.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks: A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-column-row-start-end) - This is a really handy cheat sheet for me to look back on while implementing Grid. There are still a lot of properties that I don't understand how to use yet, so this gives me a great overview of all of the features Grid has to offer.

- [MDN: The Block Quotation Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote#usage_notes) - This helped me understand how to use the ```<blockquote>``` HTML tag.

- [Kevin Powell: Build a Mosaic Portfolio Layout with CSS Grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plRcoRqLriw&list=PL4-IK0AVhVjPv5tfS82UF_iQgFp4Bl998&index=7) - This video helped me to see CSS Grid in action, as well as understand how ```fr``` units worked.
